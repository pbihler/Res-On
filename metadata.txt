Reson (Fictional element from Discworld)

Roughly translated as thingy, these particles combine to make up thaums. 
Similarly to real-world quarks, they come in five different flavours: 
Up, down, sideways, sex appeal and peppermint. They are considered to be 
the fundamental particles of reality (see Moving Pictures).

(from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_element)

"It was here that the thaum, hitherto believed to be the smallest possible 
particle of magic, was succesfully demonstrated to be made up of /resons/ 
(Lit.: 'Thing-ies') or reality fragments. Currently research indicates 
that each reson is itself made up of a combination of at least five 
'flavours', known as 'up', 'down', 'sideways', 'sex appeal' and 
'peppermint'." - Lords and Ladies
